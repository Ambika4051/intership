This school, more than a place of learning, was a cradle that nurtured my dreams, beliefs, and the very core of who I am today.  First and foremost, the teachers at DPSH believed in me. This belief wasn’t just a passing sentiment; it was a powerful force that has stayed with me, giving me strength in tough times. Their belief in my potential was like a quiet whisper of encouragement, urging me on when the path seemed daunting.  The focus on academics at DPSH was rigorous, yet it was presented in a way that made learning an adventure, not a chore. This solid academic foundation has been a pillar of my career, helping me navigate challenges with ease and confidence.  Despite being 7000 miles away, the friendships I formed at DPSH have stood the test of time and distance. These aren’t just friends; they’re a part of who I am, a testament to the quality of bonds formed in the nurturing environment of DPSH. Our connection is a bridge across continents, keeping us close no matter where we are in the world.  Basketball at DPSH was more than a game; it was a lesson in life. It taught me the value of competition, the importance of a positive attitude, and the strength that comes from believing in yourself even when doubts cloud your mind. My coach saw potential in me even when I couldn’t see it in myself, and for that, I am forever grateful.  In essence, DPSH gave me everything one could ask for from a great school. It offered not just an education, but a belief in myself, friendships that last a lifetime, practical knowledge that guides my career, and a spirit of competition and leadership that shapes my every endeavor. For all this and more, my heart is full of thanks. DPSH is more than a school to me; it's a guiding light that continues to warm my heart.</p><div class="attachment">Aluri Krishna Chaitanya, 2010 from Dpsh, Running a company in USA n UK Speechify technology</div></article></div></div><div class="carousel-item"><div class="Testimonials-Box"><article><p><div class="lazyload-wrapper ">  <img src="https://webapi.entab.info/api/image?url=DPSH/Testimonials/46500f1c54b5dd358bb035a88c3fab1a" class="img-fluid" alt="Testimonial"></div>From the very first day, we have witnessed a remarkable transformation in our child's academic journey.

        <p>Education is a lifelong process which is to be nurtured with love and care. It must be built on a firm and broad 
            foundation for students to excel in life. Our aim is to prepare our students with the intellectually-stimulated 
            learning which drives concept learning and practical approach which are necessary to meet the challenges in both 
            academics and life skills. We encourage our students to believe in themselves and their strengths. 
            The policy of the school is to strengthen the child with the necessary skills to face the future.
